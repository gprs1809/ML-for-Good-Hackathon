              " 'Parent 2': \"Now I don't have my photo.I was trying to get on and use the tablet instead of my phone.Okay that sounds good.Oh my God.I'm sorry.I don't know how to do anything.Yeah.I'm so sorry.Okay.There we go.I'm so sorry.Hi, my name is  2.I also have four children, most of the others do.So my oldest is 22, he's autistic, on the spectrum.And I have 21 year old, 18 and 15.I'll go.I feel initially my daughter went to Sea last year and so initially they were used to doing they had online setup, St Joseph by the Sea, and it was going great.And I feel they did a wonderful job and at least the kids were able to continue learning.But as we came to this year and she transferred to Tottenville, it's honestly ridiculous the way they're doing it because you are either at home or you could do blended.And blended a Tottenville means you go sit in a classroom with your computer, just like you're at home because all the teachers are at home, and the kids are in school.So they sit there with their headsets.I don't know what story is there with teachers, and I love teachers but I'm so fed up, they don't want to go back.And they're learning nothing.My daughter.I feel this year has been a complete wash.She was an 85 to 90 student now she barely passes a class, because she just has no motivation.On top of that she had major knee surgery two months ago, which that I guess made it good because she still could do the work, but I don't feel they're really learning anything.Yes.Sea did, Tottenville had to learn how to do it, which I guess they did between last year for them was a total waste because there were kids who just didn't know what they were doing.This year they know what they're doing.But it's just, number one it's either the teachers keep too long in the class or not long enough.And some of the work is just so ridiculous that they have to do and sometimes it's a lot.And sometimes it's just, I don't know, it's different because they're doing classwork and homework at home.If you're not motivated to start out with it's not quality stuff at all.They need to be in person.I know, I can't figure out how to mute myself.Stop barking.No wait, here I am.I actually am so sorry.Are you using the computer. [crosstalk 00:25:42] Are you using the computer.Because I don't know how to do anything on the tablet.Hi, yeah she barged right through it.Now I've found the mute thing.I'll talk, I had to go sit in the bathroom because it's too loud.No, I'm so sorry.I guess I anticipate a lot of anxiety, my daughter she struggles with anxiety.It doesn't help anyone, I know we have to worry about the getting but.we all actually had the virus in January.But anyway.Yeah, it's been so long.Next year she'll be a Junior,  2, Child 1, and she's never ever been in the school.I mean she's been there with my other children but she's never been taught in that school.So, she's anxious about that too.Yeah, exactly.I would say, social media and my kids they're all older and everybody has their phone, their computer, they did that.I do think that definitely watching more TV, but once again like Netflix, things like that and actually with my daughters it's been kind of nice because we went on binge fests of Supernatural and all these other kind of shows.So we spend more time together and have something to talk about that relates to use all.But that is something that I think, I don't know if it's  5 had said about, the online and stuff my 18 year old son last year.because I think she's the one who had to go to the boarding school, whoever that was, my son who was watching these videos that he began to think he was cursed from watching these videos.And we were very close to having to send him somewhere because it's almost like he became suicidal, he became so obsessed, he couldn't eat, drink, sleep, about being cursed by, he saw like these doll things, I don't even know what it was but it was something.He's always had issues but it really, so then he wasn't allowed to go on the computer, do any of that stuff but he's crazy with the video games, he plays mostly basketball and stuff which I guess is, better.But anyway that's my story.Yeah.Mm-hmm (affirmative).I mean I would say the same with the Summer coming we did our yard last year, we have a nice big pool.Last Summer was really nice with that and the kids, so they're looking forward to that and definitely the rebalancing of time indoors versus outdoors so it'll be, I think good.We're looking forward to it\",\n",
              " 'Parent 3': 'Hi, my name is  3.I have four kids.Hi.My oldest is 14.I have twin girls, they\\'re 12 and a half, and I have a 5 and a half year old.Positive.Hi, I\\'d like to say that for before the pandemic, my older girls the ones that are in middle school, they knew how to work the laptop, they have phones and stuff, but they weren\\'t 100% sure how to use the Google Classrooms and all that the programs for the actual educational material.I was a little bit upset about that, they were depressed and \"oh my god, I\\'m not going to get it done right.\" And they weren\\'t and to my knowledge the teachers weren\\'t even uploading the material correctly.So they weren\\'t getting a lot.They lost out a lot last year in terms of education really, nonetheless, they didn\\'t have in person classroom.We started With just remote, then we did blended learning that was like not really.The little one lost out most of all, she was in Pre-K.Very tough.I\\'m still working full time.I have to sit by her side while I\\'m working, while I have a call.And it was tough for her because she didn\\'t know how to turn on the laptop, she didn\\'t know how to upload her work, she still doesn\\'t know how to upload her work it\\'s hard to leave that responsibility up to a little kid that\\'s four or five.In comparison to this year, I can say it\\'s like 70% better than last year because I think that the public education is a lot more prepared than last year in terms of trying to keep up the par with the classes, more on schedule versus links that are broken and not working.They\\'re a little bit more lenient With the kids getting their work in on time, they enable them to do better by giving them small group sessions via Zoom.And that\\'s great because for example all my girls, all four of them, they\\'re fully into going to school in person.And I could say the difference between that and before is just in general my kids were like, \"I don\\'t want to go in and what we going to do and they\\'re still zooming.So just seeing that made a difference made them want to honestly go back to school in person there are teachers they to tell you, \"hey, why don\\'t you have a pen.\" Or, \"do you need extra help.\" It\\'s better when they\\'re in person, there is a difference.And they don\\'t know how to do their own work, upload it, they\\'re using Calendars which is important for day to day personal progression.Totally.I think I would to see technologies stay and if it will be mandatory, it should be blended.Technology should always be there as a part of the world and the way we move each day, and it should be mandatory and implemented within the school system and they should learn how to use it day one when they go in.They should know how to turn on the laptop or upload something, the key things, the main stuff, which they weren\\'t taught.They should have enacted force and I don\\'t think they did.So they use these things and they don\\'t know how and they don\\'t fully know how to do everything.No, it was here you go, this is it.Maybe they sent a video.I don\\'t know, something.Yeah, absolutely.Like I say my kids before the pandemic, didn\\'t really watch TV or any news or anything like that.A lot of the times they will watch Netflix, or they go on social media or like this TikTok thing and stuff like that.So whatever they hear is from on there, or from friends, and group chats.Other than that, they don\\'t really watch the news so they don\\'t really know of what\\'s going on there unless there\\'s a discussion about it within the house or they hear something from the social media.For really they\\'re just singing and dancing so I can\\'t say that it\\'s really affecting them in that way, they just know that they\\'re in the house and not really going anywhere because of this pandemic, that\\'s all they know.No, I can\\'t say that it has.Right.Well for us now I mean only because now the weather\\'s getting nicer I don\\'t have the issue with them watching as much, TV or whether they\\'re playing videos or watching TV and stuff.Because the weather is nicer, they\\'re more active.Three of the girls are closer in age and they hang out together, they\\'ll go bike riding, we have a pool they\\'ll go swimming.They\\'ll interact with each other where they\\'re not watching the TV and they don\\'t want to know what\\'s going on because they\\'re just together around each other, and they\\'re still younger, they\\'re not wanting to go out and party and all this and that.Well, I don\\'t have that issue yet.Thank you',\n",
              " 'Parent 4': 'I\\'ll go next.My name is  4.I have a two year old, a 14 year old, a 15 year old and a 17 year old.Yes, hi.I will start with my youngest he had a really difficult time adjusting as did everyone.But more difficult than my other two kids of a similar age.And he\\'s just returning maybe three weeks ago to a month ago, he\\'s just returning to school.They started out two days Monday and Tuesday and now they just set up to.He was struggling as far as not being able to meet with his other classmates and teachers.Yes, for the full week they just started although this was their first week back last week.I think Wednesday they had a flood so then they didn\\'t finish the week off.So they had to do Zoom classes Thursday and Friday and they\\'re going to go back tomorrow.They\\'re starting a full week so they\\'re going to go back Tuesday.But it seems like they had a lot of filler rather than content as far as learning and one of the parents at the school had even text in to the other parents saying, \"Do you think that the school seems to be falling off.\" Because of the way they were teaching, I don\\'t know why it went there, but they did a lot of videos more than learning things they were doing videos and dancing and things when you check in to see what they\\'re actually doing at home on the Zoom classes.But he\\'s back now and it seems there\\'s a difference even in what he\\'s learning.But he was also dealing with I think Zoom burnout because he would tell me, \"I\\'m sick of going on Zoom, I want to go to school, I want to see my teachers, I want to see my friends.\" And so it hit him very, very hard.My daughter, she\\'s 15 she was in a gifted program and she was just really let down and saying that she worked so hard and now everything she worked for was kind of just falling through, she felt.And she\\'s also just resuming going to school she goes three days out of the week.And it seems to have a better impact on her actually being there because she was in the house and she\\'s home and doing Zoom.She does the Zoom but then once Zoom is over, all three of them they all just want to be in their rooms.They don\\'t want to come out.I have to try to engage them and take them places and do things with them so that they will come out of their rooms.They just want to be in the room.And my 17 year old, he I would say was doing better with the Zoom at home than at school because, I don\\'t know, he just had issues of attending all his classes.But I still have to be on him at home because even though he\\'s at home, and he\\'s right there sitting at the desk, there are times when he can find other things to do on the computer and not be in the class and he\\'s telling me he\\'s in the classes and I\\'m checking, \"I\\'m there, I\\'m there.\" And then teachers are calling me telling me, \"Oh, he\\'s not in the class.\" So it\\'s been kind of a struggle but he\\'s doing better than he was physically at school.Academically, he\\'s doing the work, his grades are better.Right.I would say my kids are they watch TV, a little more than they did before.My youngest son, he was more a outdoors person, and now he\\'s just like, I have to tell him you can\\'t watch TV so that he isn\\'t on there 24/7, because he would be if he if you didn\\'t tell him.He\\'s on YouTube and videos, anything he could go 24/7 just in front of the TV.My oldest son 17 year old.He has set up video games on each floor, in his bedroom, in the attic and on the first floor.Just so that he can have, if his brother is in the room with him then he\\'ll go downstairs and hook up with the video game.He just has it set up so that he can be on any video games, almost like 24/7 if not that videos.My daughter she\\'s in her room on her TV, and I don\\'t know they have some kind of way they have video games on the TV where she\\'s here and they\\'re jumping around Dance Revolution-ing.But she\\'s more into the news so she will come and tell me, \"Mom, did you hear this.\" I mean she\\'s always engaged in what\\'s going on.She will come and tell me that but I think they\\'re just a little bit too much into the TV since they\\'ve been shut in.It\\'s a positive thing it\\'s not really overwhelming.It\\'s not overwhelming or depressing her or anything but she just lets me know that she knows what\\'s going on asking me do I know, constantly updated.I\\'ll just say, I just think the weather definitely has an impact.We had the first warm day and I mean it was really nice that day my son got up.He\\'s the outdoor guy.He got up he got on the scooter, he left and went around the block, on his scooter, masked up and went around the block and came back home.That following day, it was cold so I just assume that he thought that it was gonna be beautiful that day he went out in his t-shirt.I mean he actually went around the block thinking I guess, \"it\\'s going to be nice so I\\'ll go a little farther.\" But he came back and he was freezing because he just can\\'t wait to get out because we\\'ve been chatting for so long now.But I think a weather will definitely have impact on everybody because they want they all want to be outside.My oldest son he goes out and walks around the block every day.He takes the two year old that\\'s on his back, he just has to get out he just can\\'t stay inside.All right, I think you guys gave us a ton of really good insight and good information and so we really appreciate you all sharing your experiences and it really helps us understand a little bit more in depth how technology has been impacting everyone.And  maybe to talk a little bit about the town hall.Thank you',\n",
              " 'Parent 5': \"Yeah.Similarly, to some of the things that  2 said, although we've had a different experience both my kids had been using collaborative online platforms before the pandemic, which always seemed to be of benefit to the way that it was operating.And, obviously there's the benefit that this had to happen in terms of any kind of continuity.But in both cases, I think the meaningfulness of it, or any kind of robust engagement with education has really diminished.My 15 year old had a complete depressive breakdown last year, and including with hospitalizations for depressive incidents, is now at a therapeutic boarding school where at least he's there in person.So we had to have something very dramatic happen through all of that.I think that these things were underlying before but I think the circumstances around a pandemic exacerbated and accelerated this and it was certainly not helped by the pivoting to completely remote.His school, Brooklyn Tech, was just too big I think to be able to handle it meaningfully at all and so that that was a big thing there for us.And then my middle schooler, my 12 year old is really struggling, again it makes such a difference when he's able to be in person, his school is now gone to three days in person out of a six day cycle.It hasn't been able to be consistently implemented because of different cases and having to shut down from time to time.But when he's there in person, they're teaching in person, and he's a different kid.And now they hadn't been doing fully asynchronous learning before going to that platform, they had been teaching classes on Zoom.So now, you see those three days, I'll take it because I see what happens when he's there in person.But the asynchronous stuff is really not useful.It's very rote, package assignments that they dial in, it's not engaging and I would agree I think he's regressed over this year.I would say I would love to see most of these tools go out the window for a while as we go back.I'd really love to be able to see them start to work collaboratively and engage as people in person.Obviously we will still have those supports of the technology but I hope that we can start to use it as support tools and not the over-reliance on them that we've had.And I understand that I said the other day to be able to have something that is more functional and he was saying and the rote stuff.While some of the others were talking I think the thing for my 12 year old he's happier when he's there in person, but to move from that but shift it's so easy for him to now just slump all day long.And because it's all on the one platform or the one tool and when I'm working all day long and can't be checking up on him rather than going down and doing the same thing.It all just become this one little suck and it is very easy for him to be distracted and to switch to surfing the internet, or watching a video, or playing a game.So, I would just really to be able to move to actual instruction.Thank you.Yeah we also have had real issues with the time where we had been able to exercise certain amount of discipline on screen time before and it just go thrown out the window.Certainly when my 15 year old, last year it became the whole night and day got completely switched.She was spending a lot of time, like either chatting online all night or watching movies or YouTube videos, stuff like that and that got things pretty out of whack.That obviously is being addressed because he's in an environment now where he doesn't have access to that.And with the 12 year old, like still it's a struggle because he uses an iPad for school and he's always trying to switch off to watch a video.Sometimes he's playing the Nintendo Switch while he's watching a video, both things while he's supposed to be in school.Constantly having to go in and monitor that and take things away but during the day, I kept moving the switch out of the way that's what he's got.And a little bit of social media, I think with Minecraft and with friends, that's been a lot of the only way he's kept engaged with people that he knows, his friends and they're chatting that way on their Minecraft or some other video game.And both kids I don't think they consume in terms of TV per se, like again we have Netflix and stuff and NPR is always on in the background so I think they seem to be akin to what's happening in the world around.And surprisingly, sometimes I feel like 12 year old is maybe more aware of it than I think, he does ask questions about it.School seems to be pretty good at keeping discussions going on with current events.So, keep that I guess\"}"
